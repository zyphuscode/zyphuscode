# Welcome to my GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

I'm on a journey to become a fullstack developer. First stop, web dev! 

I started actively coding in early 2020. Being a self-taught developer I'm committed to learning something new everyday. I also love to share what I've learnt with fellow coders on the same journey.

While I love to solve coding challenges, I'm also interested in UX/UI design and will be tackling that next!

### Aspiration
Seeking to advance a growing tech career as a Software Developer/UX UI designer. Offering skills in application development and a great user experience to software applications and other core systems.

### What have I been doing?

Lots and lots of learning. I've finished an online bootcamp called "The complete 2020 web development bootcamp" on Udemy and currently going through Harvard's CS50.

### Hobbies

In my downtime, I enjoy baking and run a cake business. This has given me a great appreciation for not only deadlines but customer satisfaction :)

I like to create content for Instagram, where I share my day to day learnings. I recently finished #100 days of coding challenge on IG and I am part of many tech communities there.

I'm also an avid reader & enjoy participating in running events.
